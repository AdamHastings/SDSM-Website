Heidi: Hard to tell a difference because it wasn't on a laptop she was used to (didn't know how to use the trackpad)
Seemed to be faster after the patch
Web search and email was typical usage, but not solitaire.
Keyboard felt weird. Had trouble with copy/paste.
Used first google chrome window for second.

Jeff: Hard to notice a difference because he was doing things so slow to begin with.

Natalie: 1 second to 1.5 doesn't seem like much. But 10 seconds vs 15 seconds would be noticeable. Keyboard felt weird. Had trouble with copy/paste. Applications were roughly the same to what she does. Thinks she would notice slowdown if she was more familiar with computer/if she had chance to get used to machine first

Jimmy: Felt faster later. 

Sam: Felt faster later. Really slow the first web exercise. Probably a web connection issue.
